## Overview

A Testimonial Grid Section Solution from the Challange presented by Frontend Mentor... it's built with a pure HTML5 for laying out the structure, CSS for styling the website to make it more compelling, responsive and user friendly... Saas (CSS Pre-processor) which helps in executing a lot css styling with few lines of code. A little bit of Javascript was also utilized in order to make the site more interactive.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-  View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-  See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
